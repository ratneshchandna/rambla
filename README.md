Rambla is a prototype web application that serves as an online community marketplace, enabling individuals and businesses to make money by renting almost any item to anyone. The following image illustrates the rental model better:

It was created during the private beta phase of an earlier startup that didn't end up taking off. While building this web application, a lot was learnt about ASP.NET web development and web development in general. We thought it would be a good idea, thus, to open source this web application, especially for those who want to learn how to build ASP.NET MVC web applications. 

## Technologies and Frameworks Used

* ASP.NET MVC 3
* Entity Framework 4.1 Code First

## Running the Application

Open the solution in Visual Studio 2010. Build the solution to install Nuget packages. This step will automatically restore Nuget packages. Please ensure you have the latest version of Nuget installed.
